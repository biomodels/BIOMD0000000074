# Model Notes


This is model in continous darkness (DD) described in the article _Toward a
detailed computational model for the mammalian circadian clock_

This model features the full interlocked negative and positive regulation of
Per,Cry,Bmal and REV-ERBalpha. The model exhibits robust oscillations quite
independent of the initial conditions for teh parameters given. Each species
is assigned zero as initial value, and the graph started at time=120h.

Simulation results could be reproduced using Copasi 4.0.19(development) and
roadRunner online.
